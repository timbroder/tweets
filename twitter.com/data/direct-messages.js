The listing isn't live yet but our iOS posting has info about the company and mission https://t.co/grX9Jm6piN\n\nWAVE is on a mission to empower people to go out in the world and make waves. WAVE is a next generation music meditation you can feel. By combining an app, hardware cushion, and music driven content, we’re creating a multi-sensory meditation experience that helps you quickly get into a deep meditative state. We're building a brand that challenges everything people know about meditation similar to what our founders did in the yoga market with Y7 Studio.\n\nThanks!",

We have raised a 1.5M seed round from 2 sick VCs and I’m opening a rec for a Laravel contractor, in the next few days, to build the API/Nova Admin for our iOS app. Do you know anyone that’s looking or would be interested in a chat? The listing isn't live yet but our iOS posting has info about the company and mission https://t.co/grX9Jm6piN\n\nWAVE is on a mission to empower people to go out in the world and make waves. WAVE is a next generation music meditation you can feel. By combining an app, hardware cushion, and music driven content, we’re creating a multi-sensory meditation experience that helps you quickly get into a deep meditative state. We're building a brand that challenges everything people know about meditation similar to what our founders did in the yoga market with Y7 Studio.\n\nThanks!",

We have raised a 1.5M seed round from 2 sick VCs and I’m opening a rec for a Laravel contractor, in the next few days, to build the API/Nova Admin for our iOS app. Do you know anyone that’s looking or would be interested in a chat? The listing isn't live yet but our iOS posting has info about the company and mission https://t.co/grX9Jm6piN\n\nWAVE is on a mission to empower people to go out in the world and make waves. WAVE is a next generation music meditation you can feel. By combining an app, hardware cushion, and music driven content, we’re creating a multi-sensory meditation experience that helps you quickly get into a deep meditative state. We're building a brand that challenges everything people know about meditation similar to what our founders did in the yoga market with Y7 Studio.\n\nThanks!",

What happened to the app and the pivot to sleep? I really thought the integration of mindfulness and music fit perfectly in this device. This quest is personally important to me since Ive spent 2021 recovering from a near death accident, and I just hit one year of survival. I was in the process of looking to purchase the Kit, but was unable to due to the timing of the accident. As part of my recovery, I have been focused on meditation and mindfulness and have an inclinational towards sound and vibration. Do you have any way to help me access the tracks or an archived version of the app? I truly appreciate your consideration and assistance. Best, Maneesh",

We have raised a 1.5M seed round from 2 sick VCs and I’m opening a rec for a Laravel contractor, in the next few days, to build the API/Nova Admin for our iOS app. Do you know anyone that’s looking or would be interested in a chat? The listing isn't live yet but our iOS posting has info about the company and mission https://t.co/grX9Jm6piN\n\nWAVE is on a mission to empower people to go out in the world and make waves. WAVE is a next generation music meditation you can feel. By combining an app, hardware cushion, and music driven content, we’re creating a multi-sensory meditation experience that helps you quickly get into a deep meditative state. We're building a brand that challenges everything people know about meditation similar to what our founders did in the yoga market with Y7 Studio.\n\nThanks!",

We have raised a 1.5M seed round from 2 sick VCs and I’m opening a rec for a Laravel contractor, in the next few days, to build the API/Nova Admin for our iOS app. Do you know anyone that’s looking or would be interested in a chat? The listing isn't live yet but our iOS posting has info about the company and mission https://t.co/grX9Jm6piN\n\nWAVE is on a mission to empower people to go out in the world and make waves. WAVE is a next generation music meditation you can feel. By combining an app, hardware cushion, and music driven content, we’re creating a multi-sensory meditation experience that helps you quickly get into a deep meditative state. We're building a brand that challenges everything people know about meditation similar to what our founders did in the yoga market with Y7 Studio.\n\nThanks!",

For us, it looks like Americans treat Thanksgiving essentially how we'd do Christmas except with no James Bond at 3pm and all the shopping takes place after not before. We're heading back to the UK over Christmas, spending it with Lucy's parents (which apparently in 20 years of us being together, has never happened -- oops), then going up to Edinburgh (yay! - it's where we met at university, and haven't been for years so will be great to catch up with friends), then back down to see my mother before heading back here on the 31st. Should be great. Ever since I stopped travelling for work, I've rarely been in the UK. I think the only other time was going back for a long weekend for my sister's 40th. I just bought a second hand Logitech Create keyboard for my iPad Pro yesterday ($50) so I'm seeing how much I can get done with an iPad. On the upside, the screen resolution is way better on my iPad than my ~6 year old Macbook Air. On the downside, sometimes I really really want the precision of a mouse.

The good thing is though that you can pay a balloon payment to finish the lease at any time, and it still works out ~$150 cheaper than buying it straight out. I figured what the hell.

So the Activity tab all live updates, but I'd love for votes and vote count on Treeos to live update as well, and comments on Treeos once we have them. Really I could accomplish that with channels around the Treeos that are currently shown in the app and whenever there's a vote, pushing down updates to those Treeo channels, but it'd be amazing if I could somehow completely sync the app up with the database/backend, then use FRP to have everything update live.

We have raised a 1.5M seed round from 2 sick VCs and I’m opening a rec for a Laravel contractor, in the next few days, to build the API/Nova Admin for our iOS app. Do you know anyone that’s looking or would be interested in a chat? The listing isn’t live yet but our iOS posting has info about the company and mission https://t.co/grX9Jm6piN\n\nWAVE is on a mission to empower people to go out in the world and make waves. WAVE is a next generation music meditation you can feel. By combining an app, hardware cushion, and music driven content, we’re creating a multi-sensory meditation experience that helps you quickly get into a deep meditative state. We’re building a brand that challenges everything people know about meditation similar to what our founders did in the yoga market with Y7 Studio.\n\nThanks!",

Thus the person you are calling can see your caller ID for your unlisted number. For Telstra in OZ the code is *31# (you would obviously need your parents telco provider's code) This may solve your VIP Do Not Disturb Problem with your parents. Cheers, Dane.",

In case you have two minutes, would you mind taking a quick look at the website and telling me if our communication makes sense / if anything is confusing?\n \nIt would be greatly appreciated! 🙏\n \nOf course, in case you happen to know a few folks looking to buy or sell an internet startup with $100K+ in revenue, let me know! 😊\n \nHave a great day! 💚\nJP",
